# Deep CFR for Leduc Poker
Game-theoretic poker agent using Deep Counterfactual Regret Minimization (Deep CFR) to solve Leduc Poker via self-play.

## Overview
This project implements Deep CFR with external sampling and neural regret approximation in PyTorch, evaluating convergence via exploitability against best-response opponents.

## Structure
- `src/` — core implementation
- `scripts/` — environment inspection and evaluation
- `experiments/` — results and plots
